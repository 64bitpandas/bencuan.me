Despite this legal thriller being in the opposite side of the library from my usual sci-fi corner, I was blown away at how enthralling Grisham's writing is and would recommend anyone pick up one of his books (doesn't have to be this one!). I am also now an expert in the American court system, just like I am an expert in the Korean education system from reading a couple Webtoons.
