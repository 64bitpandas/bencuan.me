## tools

## ingredients
- soba noodles <Footnote n='1' client:idle />
- sesame oil
- seasoned rice vinegar
- low sodium soy sauce
- chili oil

## steps

3. Put noodles in a bowl. Add sesame oil, chili oil, rice vinegar, and soy sauce in any desired ratio.

## troubleshooting
1. <FootnoteRef n='1' client:idle>Prices can range from $1 to $10 a pack. Avoid the really cheap ones (which are usually also the ones in the asian section of non-asian groceries).</FootnoteRef>
2. <FootnoteRef n='2' client:idle>It is very important that the noodles aren't starchy. You can think about it almost like rinsing rice.</FootnoteRef>

## pairings
 - goes great with fried tofu!
