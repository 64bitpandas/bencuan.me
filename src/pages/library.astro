  <h2>about</h2>
  <p>
    I like collecting physical books on a physical bookshelf. The experience of reading isn’t complete to me without
    carrying around something tangible and being able to associate ideas and stories with the time and place I
    discovered them.
  </p>

  <p>
    While I tend to save, highlight, link, and hop all around digital content, I just start books on page 1 and trust
    the author to deliver a self-contained experience. You won’t see any notes from me besides the short post-reading
    reviews on this page.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have book recs, submit them <button class="button" data-tally-open="meeJ1J">here!</button> I’ll save them in the
    back of my mind, and if I ever stumble across it in a bookstore or library I'll grab it and let you know.
  </p>

  <h2>ratings</h2>

  <p>
    ∅ no stars: I enjoyed every book on this list, so having no stars doesn’t mean it was bad! But YMMV on these: they
    range anywhere from ‘just above average’ to ‘absolutely incredible but not for a general audience’.
  </p>
  <p>
    <IconList icon={faStar} count={1} className="intro-star" /> one star: great read! I had a fun time and learned something
    new.
  </p>
  <p>
    <IconList icon={faStar} count={2} className="intro-star two-stars" /> two stars: I recommend this book to anyone who
    likes reading. I regularly revisit it and I think about its ideas pretty regularly. new.
  </p>
  <p>
    <IconList icon={faStar} count={3} className="intro-star three-stars" /> three stars: reserved for the best of the best.
    this book changed my life and maybe it will change yours too. new.
