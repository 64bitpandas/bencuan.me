In the familiar setting of a San Francisco startup in the 2060's, Nev writes the worst bug of her life and starts falling backwards, waking up a day ago instead of a day later. It's a wildly fun read with a great concept; and in its more humorous parts, it serves a great satirization of Bay Area software engineering.
