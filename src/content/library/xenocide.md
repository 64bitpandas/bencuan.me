Xenocide is generally regarded as the weakest of the Ender Quartet, and I'm inclined to agree- but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I wouldn't recommend continuing past Speaker for the Dead unless you already know you're into science fiction, philosophy, and Card's writing style. Go read Ender's Shadow otherwise if you're looking for a continuation on fun Ender-related content.
