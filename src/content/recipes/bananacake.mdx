## notes

- trust me on the pineapple. it is the secret ingredient.
- my sweetness preference is on the low end. if you like sweet things, add an extra 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar.

## tools

- Large baking pan (11x7in)
  - Can also make muffins, multiple batches, or a fractional recipe if you don't have this exact size. I do not recommend using a loaf pan, it's too deep and might come out dry.
- Oven
- Small and large mixing bowls
- Spatula
- Blender (optional)

## steps

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Mash bananas and pineapples together in a small bowl.
3. In a large bowl, mix all dry ingredients together.
4. Add all wet ingredients into the bowl, and mix.
5. Add optional ingredients if desired.
6. Bake 40 minutes.

## ingredients

### dry

- 3 cups flour
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp cinnamon

### wet

- about half a can of 20oz crushed pineapple (with juice)
- 2 tsp vanilla
- 2-3 ripe bananas, mashed
- 1 1/3 cup canola oil
- 3 eggs

### optional addons

- chocolate chips
- chopped pecans or other nuts
  - Don't want to chop nuts? pulse in a blender for 0.5s

## troubleshooting

- didn't rise? your baking soda might be dead, buy a new box.
- you will know it's done if you stick a knife/fork/toothpick in the middle, and it comes out clean.

## pairings

- banana cake + vanilla ice cream
- honestly great just by itself
