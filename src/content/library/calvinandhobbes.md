Every couple of years, I have the urge to read as many Calvin and Hobbes strips as I can get my hands on. So far, every read has been better than the last and I don't expect this trend to ever change direction. It's a timeless collection of philosophy that can mean anything you want it to-- but really, it's just a boy going on adventures with his stuffed tiger.
