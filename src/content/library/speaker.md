There are two sides to the Ender Quartet: Ender's Game, and everything else. Speaker for the Dead is the introduction to a thoughtful exploration of otherness, and the beginning of a long redemption arc for humanity after [redacted Ender's Game spoilers]. This is far and away my favorite installment of the Ender saga.
