I've been on a lot of long haul flights recently. While I wouldn't say I enjoy them (who tf does?? teach me your ways lol) I've found a few things that make them bearable- or at least not leave me a grimy, horrendous mess at the end. I wanted to share some of them (mostly for my own reference, but also hopefully for your benefit).

I am, of course, writing this on a long flight. There's only 3 hours left, so let's see what I can do!

-=-=-

## 01\. booking

While you might already think long flights suck, they will suck even more if you paid $3000 to subject yourself to the misery.

Most credit card enthusiasts will point out that you should be using your points for plane tickets, especially business and first-class ones, since they're the highest dollar-per-point value of anything you can get. I'm not a credit card expert so I won't give any advice on this, but you should do some research to see if it's a viable option for you.

If booking with regular money, I find that [Kayak](https://www.kayak.com/) works best for me. It's especially helpful to be flexible with which dates you're flying in and out, since the prices can be rather drastic between a weekend flight and a random Wednesday evening one.

Everyone has differing opinions on which airlines are good/bad/ok. Here are mine, based on past experience:

  * Good:

    * JAL

    * ANA

    * Singapore Airlines

    * Southwest

  * Ok:

    * Air Canada

    * Delta

    * Ryanair

    * Alaska

    * Jetblue

  * Bad:

    * United

    * Spirit




## 02\. window or aisle?

While I enjoy window seats for shorter flights, the very clear choice for long flights is the aisle seat. Specifically, if you're in a larger plane with a middle section, always take one of these two rows:

![](/img/long-haul-flights/3b86b780-a265-4278-83d9-99801870f62f_558x645.png)

Why these seats specifically?

  * You don't need to bother your neighbors every time you get up / go to the bathroom.

  * You only have 1 middle seat neighbor that needs to bother you, rather than 2 if you're in a outer aisle seat.

    * (be nice to your middle seat neighbors, they’re going through a lot…)

  * On a less-full plane, you have the highest chance of getting 2 seats to yourself.

  * The right side is marginally better if you're right-handed, since you won't bump into your neighbor as much while eating/trying to get stuff from your backpack.




## 03\. packing list

 **Items I deem necessary:**

  * A good pair of noise cancelling headphones

    * earbuds are ok too, but they can get uncomfortable and the battery won't last the entire flight. I can wear my XM4's for an entire 12-hour flight and not have sore ears!

    * download some sleep music/background noise (the spotify sleep playlist works well enough for me).

  * Travel pillow

    * I use [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Cabeau-Evolution-Travel-Pillow-Quick-Dry/dp/B079X4S4DQ?th=1), which I like because I can stuff it into the little pouch to move around in between flights.

  * A jacket

    * In-flight cabin temperatures trend towards the colder side. Make sure you don't freeze to death!

  * Water

    * I always feel super dehydrated during flights, so having water on hand at all times is a must for me.




 **Nice to haves:**

  * Snacks

    * I forgot to pack snacks today and fully regret it.

  * Eyedrops

    * Pressurized cabin + overhead blowy things + staring at screens for 12 hours makes for some very dry eyes...

  * Eye mask

    * Sometimes they leave the cabin lights on, or someone on your row doesn't want to close their window :(

  * A pen

    * Many countries have immigration forms you need to fill out. You can just do it at the airport too, but might as well fill it out on the plane instead.

  * Wet wipes

    * For disinfecting the tray.

  * Power bank

    * In case your nearby power outlet is broken or occupied.




## 04\. wtf do i do for 12+ hours?

Some combination of the following:

 **A. Sleep**  
Unless you have some heroic superpower, the chances of sleeping through the entire flight are 0. but if you can, it's the best use of time!

 **B. Entertainment**  
You can always have a LOTR marathon and the entire flight will pass in the blink of an eye :)

I personally have around 15 Marvel movies to watch before I'm caught up with the MCU.

Make sure you download everything you're even remotely interested in watching, in case the in-flight entertainment isn't working or doesn't include something.

 **C. Do Nothing  
** This is a very underrated option imo. Within the writing/creative spaces, people seem to maintain a deep respect for boredom, but outside of it I get weird looks when I say I like being bored.

Nearly all of my best ideas and creations spawned from a session of Doing Nothing. Granted, sitting in a cramped, dark airplane seat is a significantly lower class of Doing Nothing than being on a train or leisurely walk, but it's still a place you're stuck in with few distractions.

## 05\. jet lag

I'm pretty good with jet lag; it never incapacitates me to the extent where I feel unable to function during regular daylight hours at my destination.

There are definitely a few things that help me with managing jet lag:

  * Keep an eye on your destination's time a couple days before the flight.

    * You don't necessarily have to shift your schedule, but do grab free opportunities to do so. For example, you could choose to pull an all-nighter before a 9am flight if 9am is actually 10pm at your destination.

  * Be ready to take lots of naps.

    * Leave room for small chunks of downtime for a couple days after your flight, where you're able to disappear from whatever you're doing and go lie down for an hour.

  * Try as hard as you can to maintain a normal schedule.

    * Even if you're wide awake at midnight, go to bed anyways. Even if you're super tired in the middle of the day, just take a short nap instead of going to sleep.




## 06\. Conclusion

Being able to go on a long flight is a privilege that not everyone can afford. That being said, it's hard to feel privileged in a cramped and uncomfortable economy seat. We'll make the best of what we can :)
