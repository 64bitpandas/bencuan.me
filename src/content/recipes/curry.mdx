## tools
- large pot
- spatula
- knife

## ingredients
- vegetable oil
- 2 blocks Japanese curry roux
- yellow curry powder
- 2 cups water or low sodium vegetable broth (don't use regular or else it'll be too salty)
- Carrots
- Potatoes
- Onion
- Garlic
- Chicken, tofu, or other protein (I like adding lentils too)
- green onion
- Chili oil (optional)
- sesame seeds (optional garnish)

## steps
1. Chop onions, carrots, potatoes, and protein into cubes.
1. Mince green onions and garlic.
1. Put oil, carrots, garlic, onions, and 1/2 of your green onions in a pot and saute at high heat for a few minutes, until slightly browned.
1. Add protein into the pot. Brown at high heat (don't cook all the way).
1. Add water/broth and bring to a boil.
1. Add curry roux, curry powder <Footnote n='2' client:idle /> and potato cubes.
1. Boil lightly until protein is cooked and potatoes are soft. It might be necessary to add more water <Footnote n='2' client:idle />
1. Top with remaining green onions and sesame.


## troubleshooting
1. <FootnoteRef n='1' client:idle>For stronger curry, add more yellow curry powder.</FootnoteRef>
2. <FootnoteRef n='2' client:idle>Curry will dry out if refrigerated, so it's fine to be slightly runny when fresh.</FootnoteRef>

## pairings
 - Serve with rice.
