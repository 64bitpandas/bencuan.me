## notes

- If you canâ€™t clean the pan immediately, soak it in hot water to dissolve the sugar.

## tools

## ingredients

- pecans
- cinnamon
- salt
- vanilla extract
- brown sugar
- water

## steps

1. Add a splash of water and vanilla to pan. More water makes the mixture more even, but will take longer to cook (and could burn). Generally be on the side of not enough water rather than too much.
2. Mix sugar, salt, and cinnamon into the water when it starts to bubble. A good ratio to start with is 1 cup sugar per 2 cups pecans.
3. The pan should now contain a brown syrup. Mix in the pecans, and cook until the syrup starts to crystallize (should feel sticky, but not wet).
4. Remove from heat and put on some parchment paper. Make sure to separate any pecans that get stuck together before they cool.
   - Pecans shouldn't be sticky after they cool.

## troubleshooting

- sticky after cooling: added too much water, or didn't cook down enough
- burnt: add more water and use less heat
- uneven: add more water and mix more evenly

## pairings

- add on salad
- eat by themselves as a snack
