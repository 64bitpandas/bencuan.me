## tools
 - pot

- miso paste <Footnote n='2' client:idle />

## steps
1. Chop the tofu into very small cubes. (smaller = better)

## troubleshooting
1. <FootnoteRef n='1' client:idle>Hondashi is a fish broth base. For a vegan alternative, acquire some [kombu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombu) and boil for 20 minutes to make kombu dashi.</FootnoteRef>
2. <FootnoteRef n='2' client:idle>If you're not sure what kind to get, I recommend Hikari white or low-sodium miso paste to start with.</FootnoteRef>

## pairings
 - Japanese breakfast: miso soup + grilled salmon + rice
 - Eat with soba noodles or rice
