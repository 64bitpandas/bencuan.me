I've been building up my personal server infrastructure for a few years now. I wanted to share my experiences in the hopes of filling in one of the biggest gaps in the traditional computer science curriculum: how to host and share the cool things we've created, and what "production deployment" really means behind the scenes.

I believe that running a server of some sort- whether it be a free cloud instance, a Raspberry Pi, or a system serving thousands of students (join the <MDLink href="https://ocf.io">OCF!</MDLink>)- should be something all CS students (really anyone curious about computers) try out.

In this series, I want to not only show you an example of how a homelab setup could look like, but also why I decided on the architecture I did so that you can make your own decisions about which parts to keep or change. This is not a step-by-step guide (there are lots of YouTube tutorials and blogs that help you achieve whatever you need to, some of which I'll link below)- I would rather help you build the intuition you need to debug, solve problems, and make decisions about your own setup.

I'll eventually port the series over to my website...
