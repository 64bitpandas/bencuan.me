Ender's Game is a book about some unrealistically smart children and their battle against authority figures in space. It also contains some deeper themes which I won't spoil for you :). I've read this two different but equally enjoyable ways: first, as a standalone book; and second, as fluffy exposition to the much heavier-hitting Speaker for the Dead.
