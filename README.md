Hi there! I'm Ben, and here's my personal website.

I've been rebuilding my website every year- if you're interested, here are the [2018](https://bencuan.me/2018), [2019](https://bencuan.me/2019), [2020](https://bencuan.me/2020), [2021](https://bencuan.me/2021), and [2022](https://bencuan.me/2022) iterations.

## About

Visit the [colophon](https://bencuan.me/colophon) for technical and philosophical information about this site.

## Development

### Quick Start

Make sure you have [Yarn v4 or greater](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

Then, run `yarn` to install all dependencies, and `yarn dev` to start the development server. You should the be able to navigate to `localhost:4321` using your favorite web browser.

### Fonts

I license the following fonts for personal web use:

- [Fraktion Sans](https://pangrampangram.com/products/fraktion)
- [Neue Montreal](https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-montreal)
- [Eiko](https://pangrampangram.com/products/eiko)
- [Novela](https://www.atipofoundry.com/fonts/novela)
- [Pine Tree](https://creativemarket.com/UppercapType/6881392-Pine-Tree-Hand-Drawn-Sans)

These fonts are not included in this repo. Feel free to acquire the appropriate licenses and place them in the `public/fonts` directory if you are interested in recreating the appearance of my site. A full list of expected files can be found in `src/sass/_fonts.scss`.

The following open source fonts are included by default:

- Rubik (sans-serif)
- Garamond (serif)

### DevEx

If you use VSCode, things should be fairly plug-and-play.

- format/lint: Prettier should run on save. You may need to install the extension.
- creating footnotes: You can use the included vscode snippets to create footnote components for MDX:
  - `footnote`
  - `ref`
