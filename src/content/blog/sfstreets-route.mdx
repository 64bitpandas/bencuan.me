## Introduction
The San Francisco Streets Project aims to answer one question: **Is it possible to walk through every major neighborhood in San Francisco in one day?**

SF is a very unique city, given its shape as a 7-mile-by-7-mile square surrounded on three sides by water. It may well be the only large city in the United States in which this is possible.

This draft is a first attempt at a solution. The route starts off at the Bayshore Caltrain Station at 9am and ends it off walking along Ocean Beach at sunset, before we loop back to the BART line.

> **Anyone is welcome to join for any segment of the journey!**

> The inaugural SFS tour will take place in early July. <br/><br/>

## Alternative Routes
SF has a *lot* of neighborhoods, and everyone has their own opinion on what counts, what they're called, and where the boundaries are. I think this route does a good job of touching all of the most well-known subdivisions- but if there is something major I missed, let me know and I'll tweak it for future iterations!

An improved or alternate route could include the following smaller neighborhoods and prominent landmarks:
 - Ingleside/Outer Mission
	 - Add a small loop around Balboa Park at the end. Very doable if running ahead of schedule.
 - Lakeshore (Lake Merced)/Parkmerced/SFSU/Stonestown
	 - Could detour the rideshare down here first before going to West Portal to add ~20 mins.
 - Actual Twin Peaks
	 - You'd need some legs of steel to do the Twin Peaks hike in the middle of a 15-mile walk, but it's on the route if you wish to attempt!
 - Coit Tower
	 - Add a 20-minute extension to the middle of Part 4.
 - Fisherman's Wharf / Pier 39 / Ghirardelli Square
	 - Add a 30-minute extension to the end of Part 4.
 - Palace of Fine Arts / Presidio / Golden Gate Bridge
	 - They're deceptively far away. If you're up to rent a bike and do a loop up between Phases 4 and 5, that would probably work the best.
 - Actually going into SoMa (Oracle Park, Salesforce Park, etc)
	 - Before getting off at Dogpatch in Part 1.5, keep going all the way to 4th and King. Walk to Moscone Center along 4th Street, then take the T back to Dogpatch.
	 - Salesforce Park is a short walk from Embarcadero BART, and can be added as a loop before departing to Part 4.
