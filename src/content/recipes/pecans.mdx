## notes

- If you canâ€™t clean the pan immediately, soak it in hot water to dissolve the sugar.

## tools
- pan
- spatula
- parchment paper

## ingredients

- pecans
- cinnamon
- salt
- vanilla extract
- brown sugar
- water

## steps

1. Add a splash of water<Footnote n='1' client:idle /> and vanilla to pan.
2. Mix sugar <Footnote n='2' client:idle />, salt, and cinnamon into the water when it starts to bubble.
3. The pan should now contain a brown syrup. Mix in the pecans, and cook until the syrup starts to crystallize (should feel sticky, but not wet).
4. Remove from heat and put on some parchment paper.<Footnote n='3' client:idle />
Make sure to separate any pecans that get stuck together before they cool.
   - Pecans shouldn't be sticky after they cool.

## troubleshooting
- <FootnoteRef n='1' client:idle>How much water should I put?</FootnoteRef>
  - More water makes the mixture more even, but will take longer to cook (and could
  burn). Generally be on the side of not enough water rather than too much.
- <FootnoteRef n='2' client:idle>How much sugar?</FootnoteRef>
  - It's entirely preference. A good ratio to start with is 1 cup sugar per 2 cups pecans.
- <FootnoteRef n='3' client:idle>sticky after cooling:</FootnoteRef> added too much water, or didn't cook down enough
- burnt: add more water and use less heat
- uneven: add more water and mix more evenly

## pairings

- add on salad
- eat by themselves as a snack
