Hi there! I'm Ben, and here's my personal website, [bencuan.me](https://bencuan.me).

![Insert image here when complete](#)

I've been rebuilding my website every summer- if you're interested, here are the [2018](https://bencuan.me/2018) and [2019](https://bencuan.me/2019) iterations.

## Development

First, run `npm i --save-dev` to install all dependencies.

To serve locally, run `npm start`.

As with most of my sites, this site is built on top of the fantastic [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/). For preprocessing, I use vanilla JavaScript and Sass with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) for HTML preprocessing. CSS is postprocessed using [postcss](https://postcss.org/) with [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/).

Some libraries and assets that I used are:
 - [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/)
 - [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
 - [Simple Grid](https://simplegrid.io)
 - [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.io)
 - [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/)
 - [Fontcustom](https://fontcustom.github.io/fontcustom/)
 - [Waypoints](https://github.com/imakewebthings/waypoints)
 - [Animated Burgers](https://march08.github.io/animated-burgers/)

If you run into any issues, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/64bitpandas/bencuan.me/issues).

### Project Structure
 - **dist/** contains all static assets (images, compiled CSS, fontcustom assets, JS).
 - **src/** contains uncompiled Sass and Liquid files. Sass and Eleventy compile these assets into the dist/ folder.
