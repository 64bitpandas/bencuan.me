            I am currently a TA for <a href="https://cs61a.org" target="_blank" class="link">CS 61A</a> at Berkeley. 
            Summer 2021 will be my 3rd time teaching the course; I'm excited to be back! (If you're a 61A student, hello!! I hope to see you around in lab/discussion/office hours :)
            <br /> <br />
            Aside from 61A, I am also an Instructional Assistant for <a href="https://atdp.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" class="link">ATDP's</a> data structures course this summer. 
            In the past (and hopefully in the future as well), I have been involved as a <a href="https://csmentors.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" class="link">CSM</a> mentor for CS 61B and
            head facilitator for the <a href="https://decal.ocf.io" target="_blank" class="link">Linux SysAdmin Decal</a>.  
            <br /> <br />
            Here are some links for my teaching resources!
