This is the book that got me into psychology. To be completely honest, I've read textbooks that were less dry than this, but I'm amazed at how Kahneman was able to pack nearly everything an average person needs to know about psychology into a single, non-back-breaking book. If you're already well-versed in modern cognitive psychology, this will likely be completely redundant. Otherwise, I recommend trading ~20 hours of your life for a truly impactful, self-contained knowledge dump.
