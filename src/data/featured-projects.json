        "description": "In 2019, I organized a 24 long hackathon for 100 high school students in Fremont, CA. <br><br> As the lead organizer, I had the opportunity to work on many different aspects such as web development, contacting sponsors, and running workshops. <br><br> Organizing a hackathon for the first time took a lot of work, but I'm glad we were able to successfully contribute to the vibrant hackathon community!"
