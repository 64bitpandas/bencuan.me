Hi there! I'm Ben, and here's my personal website, [bencuan.me](https://bencuan.me).

![Insert image here when complete]()

I've been rebuilding my website every summer- if you're interested, here are the [2018](https://bencuan.me/2018) and [2019](https://bencuan.me/2019) iterations.

## Development

First, run `npm i --save-dev` to install all dependencies.

To serve locally, run `npm start`. To build, run `npm run build`.

As with most of my sites, this site is built on top of the fantastic [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/). I've taken the liberty to add on Sass support, but everything else is made with plain HTML5 and Javascript.

Some libraries that I used are:
 - [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/)
 - [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
 - [Simple Grid](https://simplegrid.io)
