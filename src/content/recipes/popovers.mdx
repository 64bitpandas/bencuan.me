## tools
 - muffin tin
 - mixing bowl
 - whisk
 - oven

## ingredients
- 4 eggs
- 1 1/2 cup milk
- 1 1/2 cup bread flour <Footnote n='1' client:idle />
- 3 tablespoons butter

## steps
1. Place eggs in warm water and leave to rest.
2. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
3. Microwave/heat up milk until slightly above room temperature.
4. Melt butter.
5. Combine all ingredients in a medium sized bowl.
6. Whisk until air bubbles appear.
7. Grease the muffin tray with oil, and spoon in batter. One recipe should perfectly fill a regular 12-muffin tray.
8. Bake for 18 minutes. Without opening the oven <Footnote n='2' client:idle />, decrease heat to 350 and bake for another 7 minutes.

## troubleshooting
<FootnoteRef n='1' client:idle>Regular all-purpose flour is an acceptable substitution.</FootnoteRef>
<FootnoteRef n='2' client:idle>DO NOT open the oven until you're ready to take it out. I did it once and they got very deflated and sad :(</FootnoteRef>

## pairings
 - dip in butter + cinnamon sugar before baking
 - serve with jam, marmalade, salted spreadable butter
 - mix in cheese, herbs, or spices to the batter
