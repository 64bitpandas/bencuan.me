## troubleshooting
1. <FootnoteRef n='1' client:idle>Try to find Asian tofu brands. American tofu has a slightly different taste and consistency.</FootnoteRef>
2. <FootnoteRef n='2' client:idle>Size is totally to your preference; smaller pieces will be tastier/crispier but requires more work.</FootnoteRef>
