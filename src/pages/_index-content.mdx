## :house: welcome to my internet home!
glad you're here :) hope you'll stick around for a bit!

#### a little about me:

I'm currently a systems engineer building production- and research-ready infra at 
<MDLink href="https://preview.reve.art">:last_quarter_moon: Reve</MDLink> <Pronunciation word="Reve" ipa="ʁɛv" audioFile="/audio/reve.mp3" client:load/>. We're dreaming up the future of creative tooling-- excited to say more about it soon!

Previously, I was a codepoint fellow at <MDLink href="https://shv.com/">:snowflake: Sutter Hill Ventures</MDLink>, made a few games (and composed their soundtracks!) with my friends at <MDLink href="https://hexcaliber.dev/games">:joystick: Hexcaliber Games</MDLink>,
general-managered at the <MDLink href="https://ocf.io">:penguin: Open Computing Facility</MDLink>, and 
:bear: <MDLink href="https:/cs186berkeley.net">taught</MDLink> <MDLink href="https:/cs61a.org">a</MDLink> <MDLink href="https://decal.ocf.io">few</MDLink> <MDLink href="https://atdp.berkeley.edu">classes</MDLink> at UC Berkeley.

I write long-form musings about history, technology, and community on my <MDLink href="https://bencuan.me/blog">blog</MDLink>. My latest post is about <MDLink href="https://bencuan.me/blog/transit">my relentless optimism towards Bay Area transit</MDLink>. You can also find life updates / rough drafts on <MDLink href="https://bencuan.substack.com">substack</MDLink>.

{/* My desk is a mess of half-finished thoughts and sprawled-out ideas these days; I hope to untangle and share some of them with you in the near future! More broadly, some things I've been thinking a lot about are:
- multimodal digital storytelling (à la <MDLink href="https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/chapter-1">Jon Bois</MDLink>, <MDLink href="https://everythingi.love/">Chia Amisola</MDLink>, <MDLink href="https://www.youtube.com/@JacobGeller">Jacob Geller</MDLink>, and more) */}
