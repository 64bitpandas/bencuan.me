## tools

- Large baking pan (9x13in)
  - Can also make muffins, multiple batches, or a fractional recipe if you don't have this exact size. I do not recommend using a loaf pan, it's too deep and might come out dry.
- Oven
- Small and large mixing bowls
- Spatula
- Large mixing bowl
- Medium mixing bowl
- Blender (optional)

## steps

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Mash bananas and pineapples together in a small bowl.
3. In a large bowl, mix all dry ingredients together.`
4. In a medium bowl, mix all wet ingredients together.
5. Add all wet ingredients into the big bowl, and mix.
6. Add optional ingredients if desired.
7. Bake 40 minutes.<Footnote n='1' client:idle />

## troubleshooting

1. <FootnoteRef n='1' client:idle>you will know it's done if you stick a knife/fork/toothpick in the middle, and it comes out clean.</FootnoteRef>
2. <FootnoteRef n='2' client:idle>my sweetness preference is on the low end. if you like sweet things, add an extra 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar.</FootnoteRef>
3. <FootnoteRef n='3' client:idle>didn't rise? your baking soda might be dead, buy a new box.</FootnoteRef>

## pairings

- banana cake + vanilla ice cream
- honestly great just by itself
